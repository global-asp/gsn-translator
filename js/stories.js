I lifted it and sniffed that glorious smell."},{"07":"Grandma's voice startled me when she called, \"What are you doing? Hurry up and bring me the stick.\"  I hurried out with her walking stick. \"What are you smiling about?\" Grandma asked.  Her question made me realise that I was still smiling at the discovery of her magic place."},{"08":"The following day when grandma came to visit my mother, I rushed to her house to check the bananas once more.  There was a bunch of very ripe ones. I picked one and hid it in my dress. After covering the basket again, I went behind the house and quickly ate it. It was the sweetest banana I had ever tasted."},{"09":"The following day, when grandma was in the garden picking vegetables, I sneaked in and peered at the bananas.  Nearly all were ripe. I couldn't help taking a bunch of four.  As I tiptoed towards the door, I heard grandma coughing outside. I just managed to hide the bananas under my dress and walked past her."},{"10":"The following day was market day. Grandma woke up early. She always took ripe bananas and cassava to sell at the market.  I did not hurry to visit her that day.

One day while Gingile was out hunting he heard the call of Ngede. Gingile's mouth began to water at the thought of honey. He stopped and listened carefully, searching until he saw the bird in the branches above his head. \"Chitik-chitik-chitik,\" the little bird rattled, as he flew to the next tree, and the next. \"Chitik, chitik, chitik,\" he called, stopping from time to time to be sure that Gingile followed."},{"03":"After half an hour, they reached a huge wild fig tree. Ngede hopped about madly among the branches. He then settled on one branch and cocked his head at Gingile as if to say, \"Here it is! Come now! What is taking you so long?\" Gingile couldn't see any bees from under the tree, but he trusted Ngede."},{"04":"So Gingile put down his hunting spear under the tree, gathered some dry twigs and made a small fire. When the fire was burning well, he put a long dry stick into the heart of the fire. This wood was especially known to make lots of smoke while it burned. He began climbing, holding the cool end of the smoking stick in his teeth."},{"05":"Soon he could hear the loud buzzing of the busy bees. They were coming in and out of a hollow in the tree trunk – their hive. When Gingile reached the hive he pushed the smoking end of the stick into the hollow. The bees came rushing out, angry and mean. They flew away because they didn't like the smoke – but not before they had given Gingile some painful stings!"},{"06":"When the bees were out, Gingile pushed his hands into the nest. He took out handfuls of the heavy comb, dripping with rich honey and full of fat, white grubs. He put the comb carefully in the pouch he carried on his shoulder, and started to climb down the tree."},{"07":"Ngede eagerly watched everything that Gingile was doing. He was waiting for him to leave a fat piece of honeycomb as a thank-you offering to the Honeyguide. Ngede flittered from branch to branch, closer and closer to the ground. Finally Gingile reached the bottom of the tree. Ngede perched on a rock near the boy and waited for his reward."},{"08":"But, Gingile put out the fire, picked up his spear and started walking home, ignoring the bird. Ngede called out angrily, \"VIC-torr! VIC-torrr!\" Gingile stopped, stared at the little bird and laughed aloud. \"You want some honey, do you, my friend? Ha! But I did all the work, and got all the stings. Why should I share any of this lovely honey with you?\" Then he walked off. Ngede was furious! This was no way to treat him! But he would get his revenge."},{"09":"One day several weeks later Gingile again heard the honey call of Ngede. He remembered the delicious honey, and eagerly followed the bird once again. After leading Gingile along the edge of the forest, Ngede stopped to rest in a great umbrella thorn. \"Ahh,\" thought Gingile. \"The hive must be in this tree.\" He quickly made his small fire and began to climb, the smoking branch in his teeth. Ngede sat and watched."},{"10":"Gingile climbed, wondering why he didn't hear the usual buzzing. \"Perhaps the hive is deep in the tree,\" he thought to himself. He pulled himself up another branch. But instead of the hive, he was staring into the face of a leopard! Leopard was very angry at having her sleep so rudely interrupted. She narrowed her eyes, opened her mouth to reveal her very large and very sharp teeth."},{"11":"Before Leopard could take a swipe at Gingile, he rushed down the tree. In his hurry he missed a branch, and landed with a heavy thud on the ground twisting his ankle. He hobbled off as fast as he could. Luckily for him, Leopard was still too sleepy to chase him. Ngede, the Honeyguide, had his revenge. And Gingile learned his lesson."},{"12":"And so, when the children of Gingile hear the story of Ngede they have respect for the little bird. Whenever they harvest honey, they make sure to leave the biggest part of the comb for Honeyguide!"}]},{"i":"0262","t":"Magozwe","a":"b|Lesley Koyi|Wiehan de Jager","s":[{"02":"In the busy city of Nairobi, far away from a caring life at home, lived a group of homeless boys. They welcomed each day just as it came.  On one morning, the boys were packing their mats after sleeping on cold pavements. To chase away the cold they lit a fire with rubbish.  Among the group of boys was Magozwe. He was the youngest."},{"03":"When Magozwe's parents died, he was only five years old. He went to live with his uncle. This man did not care about the child. He did not give Magozwe enough food. He made the boy do a lot of hard work."},{"04":"If Magozwe complained or questioned, his uncle beat him. When Magozwe asked if he could go to school, his uncle beat him and said, \"You're too stupid to learn anything.\"  After three years of this treatment Magozwe ran away from his uncle. He started living on the street."},{"05":"Street life was difficult and most of the boys struggled daily just to get food. Sometimes they were arrested, sometimes they were beaten. When they were sick, there was no one to help.  The group depended on the little money they got from begging, and from selling plastics and other recycling.  Life was even more difficult because of fights with rival groups who wanted control of parts of the city."},{"06":"One day while Magozwe was looking through the dustbins, he found an old tattered storybook. He cleaned the dirt from it and put it in his sack.  Every day after that he would take out the book and look at the pictures. He did not know how to read the words."},{"07":"The pictures told the story of a boy who grew up to be a pilot.  Magozwe would daydream of being a pilot. Sometimes, he imagined that he was the boy in the story."},{"08":"It was cold and Magozwe was standing on the road begging. A man walked up to him. \"Hello, I'm Thomas. I work near here, at a place where you can get something to eat,\" said the man.  He pointed to a yellow house with a blue roof. \"I hope you will go there to get some food?\" he asked.  Magozwe looked at the man, and then at the house. \"Maybe,\" he said, and walked away."},{"09":"Over the months that followed, the homeless boys got used to seeing Thomas around. He liked to talk to people, especially people living on the streets.  Thomas listened to the stories of people's lives. He was serious and patient, never rude or disrespectful. Some of the boys started going to the yellow and blue house to get food at midday."},{"10":"Magozwe was sitting on the pavement looking at his picture book when Thomas sat down next to him.  \"What is the story about?\" asked Thomas.  \"It's about a boy who becomes a pilot,\" replied Magozwe.  \"What's the boy's name?\" asked Thomas.  \"I don't know, I can't read,\" said Magozwe quietly."},{"11":"When they met, Magozwe began to tell his own story to Thomas. It was the story of his uncle and why he ran away.  Thomas didn't talk a lot, and he didn't tell Magozwe what to do, but he always listened carefully.  Sometimes they would talk while they ate at the house with the blue roof."},{"12":"Around Magozwe's tenth birthday, Thomas gave him a new storybook. It was a story about a village boy who grew up to be a famous soccer player.  Thomas read that story to Magozwe many times, until one day he said, \"I think it's time you went to school and learned to read. What do you think?\" Thomas explained that he knew of a place where children could stay, and go to school."},{"13":"Magozwe thought about this new place, and about going to school. What if his uncle was right and he was too stupid to learn anything?  What if they beat him at this new place? He was afraid. \"Maybe it is better to stay living on the street,\" he thought."},{"14":"He shared his fears with Thomas. Over time the man reassured the boy that life could be better at the new place."},{"15":"And so Magozwe moved into a room in a house with a green roof. He shared the room with two other boys.  Altogether there were ten children living at that house. Along with Auntie Cissy and her husband, three dogs, a cat, and an old goat."},{"16":"Magozwe started school and it was difficult. He had a lot to catch up. Sometimes he wanted to give up.  But he thought about the pilot and the soccer player in the storybooks. Like them, he did not give up."},{"17":"Magozwe was sitting in the yard at the house with the green roof, reading a storybook from school. Thomas came up and sat next to him.  \"What is the story about?\" asked Thomas.  \"It's about a boy who becomes a teacher,\" replied Magozwe.  \"What's the boy's name?\" asked Thomas.  \"His name is Magozwe,\" said Magozwe with a smile."}]},{"i":"0052","t":"Simbegwire","a":"b|Rukia Nantale|Benjamin Mitchley","s":[{"02":"When Simbegwire's mother died, she was very sad.

After they washed the dishes, Simbegwire's father helped her with homework."},{"03":"One day, Simbegwire's father came home later than usual. \"Where are you my child?\" he called.

This is Anita,\" he said smiling."},{"04":"\"Hello Simbegwire, your father told me a lot about you,\" said Anita. But she did not smile or take the girl's hand.

He talked about the three of them living together, and how good their life would be. \"My child, I hope you will accept Anita as your mother,\" he said."},{"05":"Simbegwire's life changed. She no longer had time to sit with her father in the mornings. Anita gave her so many household chores that she was too tired to do her school work in the evenings. She went straight to bed after dinner. Her only comfort was the colourful blanket her mother gave her. Simbegwire's father did not seem to notice that his daughter was unhappy."},{"06":"After a few months, Simbegwire's father told them that he would be away from home for a while. \"I have to travel for my job,\" he said. \"But I know you will look after each other.\" Simbegwire's face fell, but her father did not notice. Anita did not say anything. She was not happy either."},{"07":"Things got worse for Simbegwire. If she didn't finish her chores, or she complained, Anita hit her.

Each night Simbegwire cried herself to sleep, hugging her mother's blanket."},{"08":"One morning, Simbegwire was late getting out of bed. \"You lazy girl!\" Anita shouted. She pulled Simbegwire out of bed. The precious blanket caught on a nail, and tore in two."},{"09":"Simbegwire was very upset. She decided to run away from home. She took the pieces of her mother's blanket, packed some food, and left the house. She followed the road her father had taken."},{"10":"When it came to evening, she climbed a tall tree near a stream and made a bed for herself in the branches. As she went to sleep, she sang: \"Maama, maama, maama, you left me. You left me and never came back. Father doesn't love me anymore. Mother, when are you coming back? You left me.\""},{"11":"The next morning, Simbegwire sang the song again. When the women came to wash their clothes at the stream, they heard the sad song coming from the tall tree. They thought it was only the wind rustling the leaves, and carried on with their work. But one of the women listened very carefully to the song."},{"12":"This woman looked up into the tree. When she saw the girl and the pieces of colourful blanket, she cried, \"Simbegwire, my brother's child!\" The other women stopped washing and helped Simbegwire to climb down from the tree. Her aunt hugged the little girl and tried to comfort her."},{"13":"Simbegwire's aunt took the child to her own house. She gave Simbegwire warm food, and tucked her in bed with her mother's blanket. That night, Simbegwire cried as she went to sleep. But they were tears of relief. She knew her aunt would look after her."},{"14":"When Simbegwire's father returned home, he found her room empty. \"What happened, Anita?\" he asked with a heavy heart. The woman explained that Simbegwire had run away. \"I wanted her to respect me,\" she said. \"But perhaps I was too strict.\" Simbegwire's father left the house and went in the direction of the stream. He continued to his sister's village to find out if she had seen Simbegwire."},{"15":"Simbegwire was playing with her cousins when she saw her father from far away. She was scared he might be angry, so she ran inside the house to hide. But her father went to her and said, \"Simbegwire, you have found a perfect mother for yourself. One who loves you and understands you. I am proud of you and I love you.\" They agreed that Simbegwire would stay with her aunt as long as she wanted to."},{"16":"Her father visited her every day. Eventually, he came with Anita. She reached out for Simbegwire's hand. \"I'm so sorry little one, I was wrong,\" she cried. \"Will you let me try again?\" Simbegwire looked at her father and his worried face. Then she stepped forward slowly and put her arms around Anita."},{"17":"The next week, Anita invited Simbegwire, with her cousins and aunt, to the house for a meal. What a feast! Anita prepared all of Simbegwire's favourite foods, and everyone ate until they were full. Then the children played while the adults talked. Simbegwire felt happy and brave. She decided that soon, very soon, she would return home to live with her father and her stepmother."}]}]
